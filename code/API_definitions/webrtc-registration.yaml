  title: WebRTC Registration Service
  description: |-
    # Introduction
    This API provides the API consumer with the capabilities to manage
    registration and connectivity towards the network.

    The network requires that the API consumer application registers and
    identifies an end user device before enabling any media
    session services provided by the WebRTC APIs.

    A device registration created via this API will register a unique `deviceId`
    created by the API consumer (WebRTC application) and it will will provide a
    `registrationId` to manage a registration later.
    Any subsequent request from the API consumer must include the unique
    `registrationId` that will be linked to the registration previously defined.

    All operator network services are based on device registrations, this API
    allows the user to create a registration session that enable the audio/video
    functionalities exposed by the operator network.

    **Use cases to cover:**
      - Functional:
        - Ability to create Registration sessions on the network, this grants
          access to create new audio and video sessions.
        - Ability to update or remove Registration sessions on the network
      - An additional subscription to webrtc-events API is required to receive
        incoming calls.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    - **registration** A media device session. A valid client running on a valid
      device, with permission to use the network capabilities to create and receive
      (audio/video) calls (media sessions).
    - **registrationId**: Unique identifier of an WebRTC device **registration**.
      Retrieved using the `webrtc-registration` API
    - **deviceId**: A unique identifier for the physical device where a media
      session is initiated. It is provided by the WebRTC application, it remains
      consistent across multiple installations or logins on the same device. Its
      primary function is to ensure that only one WebRTC session (**registration**)
      is active per device at a time, enabling the gateway to clean up any stale
      sessions if a new session is initiated on the same device.
    - **media session**: An exchange of media between devices.
      Typical example of session is a "single one-to-one call".
    - **mediaSessionId**: Unique identifier of a Voice or Video **session** using
      webrtc-call-handling API. Retrieved using the `webrtc-call-handling` API
    - **x-correlator**: Unique ID included in the API request created by the API consumer.
      It is used to correlate an API request with its response and help in debugging.
    - **WebRTC**: WebRTC is a free and open-source project providing web browsers
      and mobile applications with real-time communication via application programming
      interfaces. It allows audio and video communication and streaming to work
      inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication
    - **SDP**: Acronym for Session Description Protocol. The SDP is a format for
      describing multimedia communication sessions for the purposes of announcement
      and invitation.

    # API functionality

    This API allows to create device registrations. These, identified by a unique
    `registrationId` can be updated and terminated via this API and its methods.
    - **POST**: Create a new device registration using a valid authorization token.
    - **PUT**: Update a device registration via its unique `registrationId`
    - **DELETE**: Finish an existing device registration via its unique `registrationId`
    To receive server-side updates about new voice-video sessions, you need to
    use `webrtc-events` API.

    The main concept of the API is pretty straightforward: a subscriber needs a
    session to create calls, so you will need a subscription on your device before
    attempt any audio/video call.

    Once you create a session, you can:
    - Use `webrtc-events` API to create a subscription and receive incoming calls.
    - Use `webrtc-call-handling` API to create a audio/video session and create
      an outgoing call.

    Check for extra details on each of these APIs already present on the WebRTC
    repository.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an
    API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent
    Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the
    onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider,
    taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also
    being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise
    their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of
    three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains
    in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of
    transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive.
    Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error
    statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release
    associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The
    applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness
    Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible
    error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

      description: |-
        API endpoint used to **refresh** an existing registration *before* it
        expires.

        **Server behaviour on refresh**

        1. Let `t_req` be the server-side receipt time of the request and
           `t_prev` the previously stored `registrationExpireTime`.
        2. Compute the remaining lifetime
              remaining = t_prev - t_req
           (values ≤ 0 indicate the client is late; operators MAY reject or
           treat it as a new registration).
        3. Apply the operator's configured TTL (`TTL_cfg`, e.g. 3600 s) **from
           `t_req`, not from `t_prev`**:
              newExpire = t_req + TTL_cfg
        4. Persist `newExpire` and return it in `expiresAt` inside the
           response body.

        Clients SHOULD plan to refresh well **before** `newExpire` to avoid
        race conditions.

            Client applications should compute the remaining time before expiry (expiresAt - currentTime)
            and plan to refresh well in advance to avoid race conditions. A suggested margin is 120 seconds before expiry.
