  title: WebRTC Registration Service API
  description: |-
    ## 1. Introduction
    This API provides the API consumer with the capabilities to manage
    Registration and Connectivity towards network.

    The network requires that all endpoints identify the subscriber and create a
    session before enable or activate any service. In order to create audio and
    video sessions, you device (or endpoint) need to have a valid registration on
    the network. This API provide that feature, and allow users to create audio and
    video sessions using the telco network.

    All telco services are based on subscriptions, this API allows the user to
    create a session where you can consume the audio/video part of the telco services.

    **Use cases to cover:**
      - Functional:
        - Ability to create Registration sessions on the network, this grants
          access to create new audio and video sessions.
        - Ability to update or remove Registration sessions on the network
      - An additional subscription to webrtc-events API is required to receive
        incoming calls.

    ## 2. Relevant terms and definitions

    - **regSession** A registration session. A valid client running on a valid
      device, with permission to use the network capabilities to create and receive
      calls (audio/video sessions).
    - **regSessionId**: Unique identifier of an WebRTC endpoint **registration**.
      Retrieved using the `webrtc-registration` API
    - **deviceId**: A unique identifier for the physical device where a WebRTC
      session is initiated. It is provided by the WebRTC application, it remains
      consistent across multiple installations or logins on the same device. Its
      primary function is to ensure that only one WebRTC session (**regSession**)
      is active per device at a time, enabling the gateway to clean up any stale
      sessions if a new session is initiated on the same device.
    - **clientId**: A unique identifier, assigned by the network, for each client
      instance or **regSession**. It is best practice for the gateway to issue a new
      clientId for each login or session. This approach helps the gateway maintain
      clear indexing or mapping for quicker processing and simplifies troubleshooting
      by clearly distinguishing one session from another.
    - **WebRTC**: WebRTC is a free and open-source project providing web browsers
      and mobile applications with real-time communication via application programming
      interfaces. It allows audio and video communication and streaming to work
      inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication
    - **SDP**: Acronym for Session Description Protocol. The SDP is a format for
      describing multimedia communication sessions for the purposes of announcement
      and invitation.

    ## 3. API functionality

    This API allows to create device registrations. These, identified by a unique
    `regSessionId` can be updated and terminated via this API and its methods.
    - **POST**: Create a new device registration using a valid authorization token.
    - **PUT**: Update a device registration via its unique `regSessionId`
    - **DELETE**: Finish an existing device registration via its unique `regSessionId`
    To receive server-side updates about new voice-video sessions, you need to
    use `webrtc-events` API.

    The main concept of the API is pretty straightforward: a subscriber needs a
    session to create calls, so you will need a subscription on your device before
    attempt any audio/video call.

    Once you create a session, you can:
    - Use `webrtc-events` API to create a subscription and receive incoming calls.
    - Use `webrtc-call-handling` API to create a audio/video session and create
      an outgoing call.

    Check for extra details on each of these APIs already present on the WebRTC
    repository.

    ## 4. Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an
    API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent
    Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the
    onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider,
    taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also
    being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise
    their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of
    three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains
    in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of
    transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.
