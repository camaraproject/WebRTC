  title: WebRTC Call Handling
  description: |-
    # Introduction

    This API provides REST API for clients to manage live audio and video sessions
    towards the operator's network (IMS network).

    To handle audio/video sessions, what we usually known as *calls*, the network
    requires to identify both involved parties: caller, the origin, and the callee,
    the destination. Once the involved communication endpoints are identified,
    the endpoints need to negotiate *how* to send media from one endpoint to the other.

    The first step, *identify the endpoints* is handled through
    parameters in the API request. The latter step, *negotiate how to connect*, is done by
    sharing media transmission requirements (called SDP information) between the involved endpoints.

    In this step, the WebRTC technology is used to simplify the access to the
    media, and get a simple and well-known protocol to negotiate the media transmission
    requirements.

    Let's dig into more details on section 3: API functionality

    **Use cases to cover:**
      - Functional:
        - Ability to create audio and video sessions on the network, this grants
          ability to reach any phone number on the public network using your telco
          provider rights.
        - Ability to retrieve any session, to recover for a network disconnection
          or to check current status for any reason.
        - Ability to upgrade to video, change sending audio/video parameters, or
          notify the network about any modification on your side of the calls.
        - Ability to hangup the call. Stop the transmission, and delete your audio
          and video session.
      - An additional subscription to webrtc-events API is required to receive
        incoming events from network side (ex. remote hangup event).

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    - **media session**: An exchange of media between devices.
      Typical example of session is a "single one-to-one call".
    - **mediaSessionId**: Unique identifier of a **media session** using
      webrtc-call-handling API. Retrieved using the `webrtc-call-handling` API
    - **deviceId**: A unique identifier for the physical device where a media
      session is initiated. It is provided by the WebRTC application, it remains
      consistent across multiple installations or logins on the same device. Its
      primary function is to ensure that only one WebRTC session (**registration**)
      is active per device at a time, enabling the network to clean up any stale
      sessions if a new session is initiated on the same device.
    - **registration**: A device status in which the device is properly
      identified and recognized as reachable by the server side of the network.
    - **registrationId**: Unique identifier of an device **registration**.
      Retrieved using the `webrtc-registration` API
    - **x-correlator**: Unique ID included in the API request created by the API consumer.
      It is used to correlate an API request with its response and help in debugging.
    - **WebRTC**: WebRTC is a free and open-source project providing web browsers
      and mobile applications with real-time communication via application programming
      interfaces. It allows audio and video communication and streaming to work
      inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication
    - **SDP**: Acronym for Session Description Protocol. The SDP is a format for
      describing multimedia communication sessions for the purposes of announcement
      and invitation.
    - **WrtcSDPDescriptor**: Schema to include inside a JSON, a SDP body. You can
      obtain an SDP for WebRTC calling using the WebRTC API provided by the browser
      or any other media library.

    # API functionality

    This API allows to create 1-1 voice and video sessions. These, identified by a
    unique `mediaSessionId` can be recovered, updated and terminated via this API
    and its methods.
    - **POST**: Create a new session using a valid `registrationId` from registration API
    - **GET**: Recover an existing session via its unique `mediaSessionId`
    - **DELETE**: Finish an existing session via its unique `mediaSessionId`
    - **PUT**: Update the status of a session via its unique `mediaSessionId`

    To receive updates from the network about the session establishment process, you
    must use `webrtc-events` API.

    ## 1. Creating a call

    To call someone, you need, previously a valid registration on the network.
    You must check the webrtc-registration API to retrieve a valid registration
    on the network that allows you to send calls (IMS registration).

    Once this is completed, you can consume the POST /sessions/ endpoint to call
    a remote destination.

    ```
    POST /webrtc-call-handling/v0.2/sessions
    {
      "originatorAddress": "tel:+17085852753",
      "receiverAddress": "tel:+17085854000",
    }
    ```

    This will create a call, but without local media you will have a problem, or
    maybe the network will reject your call. You need to add a local SDP offer.

    > **The WebRTC SDP local candidate**
    >
    > What is usually done, before attempt to create a call, is to solve the SDP local
    description. This is, how you are going to send the media. To explain it briefly,
    browsers offer the
    [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) that
    include `getUserMedia()` and `RTCPeerConnection` interfaces that will simplify
    the process.
    >
    > In summary, we need to obtain the media, create the `RTCPeerConnection`
    and use it's SDP on our CAMARA webrtc-call-handling API as the offer. There
    is extra information about this concept on the SupportingDocuments folder.

    Once you retrieve you local SDP offer, you modify your session including it,
    or maybe you prefer to solve the local candidate before attempt the call, in
    that case, you will include your local offer on the audio/video session creation.

    ```
    POST /webrtc-call-handling/v0.2/sessions
    {
        "originatorAddress": "tel:+17085852753",
        "receiverAddress": "tel:+17085854000",
        "offer": {
            "sdp": "v=0\r\no=- 4808447918291752114 2 IN IP4 127.0.0.1\r\ns=-\r\nt=0 0\r\na=group:BUNDLE 0\r\na=extmap-allow-mixed\r\na=msid-semantic: WMS 0893fb9b-23c2-4571-a26d-13cb0f4fed9f\r\nm=audio 13765 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 111 63 9 0 8 13 110 126\r\nc=IN IP4 123.123.123.123\r\na=rtcp:9 IN IP4 0.0.0.0\r\na=candidate:959305279 1 udp 2113937151 26e1f6e6-f0cb-47fb-a1b4-afa62b6a7f29.local 50745 typ host generation 0 network-cost 999\r\na=candidate:3375440286 1 udp 1677729535 123.123.123.123 13765 typ srflx raddr 0.0.0.0 rport 0 generation 0 network-cost 999\r\na=ice-ufrag:YoUo\r\na=ice-pwd:kK5J6IAgiKFDFU+2rC+FyZal\r\na=ice-options:trickle\r\na=fingerprint:sha-256 CF:56:D8:57:9B:68:B2:1C:F6:ED:6C:CO:02:7C:96:C2:88:A3:C2:38:AD:A2:CA:F5:0D:47:BB:81:74:7B:75:17\r\na=setup:actpass\r\na=mid:0\r\na=extmap:1 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:ssrc-audio-level\r\na=extmap:2 http://www.webrtc.org/experiments/rtp-hdrext/abs-send-time\r\na=extmap:3 http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-holmer-rmcat-transport-wide-cc-extensions-01\r\na=extmap:4 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:sdes:mid\r\na=sendrecv\r\na=msid:0893fb9b-23c2-4571-a26d-13cb0f4fed9f 2daf5a1e-d3bf-4d4e-95db-b8623fce4176\r\na=rtcp-mux\r\na=rtcp-rsize\r\na=rtpmap:111 opus/48000/2\r\na=rtcp-fb:111 transport-cc\r\na=fmtp:111 minptime=10;useinbandfec=1\r\na=rtpmap:63 red/48000/2\r\na=fmtp:63 111/111\r\na=rtpmap:9 G722/8000\r\na=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000\r\na=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000\r\na=rtpmap:13 CN/8000\r\na=rtpmap:110 telephone-event/48000\r\na=rtpmap:126 telephone-event/8000\r\na=ssrc:932268938 cname:mzxQSFSDV3JpfIJY\r\na=ssrc:932268938 msid:0893fb9b-23c2-4571-a26d-13ccof4fed9f 2daf5a1e-d3bf-4d4e-95db-b8623fce4176\r\n"
            }
    }
    ```

    Following this point, your call is progressing and the network will inform
    about extra information required and connection status via de the
    webrtc-events API.

    Check webrtc-events API inline documentation and supporting documents
    for further information.

    ## 2. Hanging up a call

    When you have a voice/video session in progress, you can decide to finish the
    call, to do so, simply execute a DELETE request of the session using the
    `mediaSessionId` obtained on call creation.

    This action will trigger all necessary action on the network side to properly
    hangup and drop the call.

    ## 3. Picking up a call

    Using the `webrtc-events` API, you can receive events from the network, these
    events could include the `session-invitation` event. This means that someone
    is calling you.

    To *hook off*, we need to retrieve the session based on the `mediaSessionId`
    using the GET request, afterwards, you can present to the user some
    confirmation option to accept the call.

    Final step is to include a local offer. We already seen at 3.1 that a local
    SDP is required, in this case, we will use the PUT request to modify the
    audio/video session and include the information about the responding device.

    Let's say that we are responding this session `0AEE1B58BAEEDA3EABA42B32EBB3DFE0DEAD`:
    ```
    PUT /webrtc-call-handling/v0.2/sessions/0AEE1B58BAEEDA3EABA42B32EBB3DFE0DEAD/status
    {
        "status": "InProgress",
        "answer": {

            }
    }

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an
    API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent
    Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the
    onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider,
    taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also
    being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise
    their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of
    three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains
    in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of
    transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses
    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive.
    Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error
    statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release
    associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The
    applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness
    Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible
    error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

    # Emergency Calling
    - Introduces a new `callType` attribute with values `REGULAR` or `EMERGENCY`.
    - When `callType` is `EMERGENCY`, the client **MAY** include `locationDetails`
    describing the caller's location.
    - `locationDetails` follows PIDF-LO concepts (3GPP TS 24.229, RFC 4119, RFC 5139,
    RFC 5491) with either a circle or ellipsoid shape.
    - If `callType` is omitted, it defaults to `REGULAR`.
